LAYOUT DESCRIPTION

The App has a title bar with a logo and app name on the top, the main content in the middle and a footer with text information. Widgets are placed in the main content area in a grid. Thsi grid consists of columns and rows. 

Follow the layout in the SVG attached in the prompt (e.g. layout.png) as a guide for placing widgets in this grid. DO NOT follow positions literally. Example: The HTML element on the top left would be placed on cell (1,1) in the grid I described; The element to its right would be on on cell (1,2) -- row 1, column 2. Textual elements should be placed as Flutter text (they are labels).

Not all columns will have the same number of Widgets. In this case, follow cell placement and use and empty Widget to fill empty cells.

Read the logo in 'assets/img/logo.png' when placing the logo on the app bar.

Use the provided 'assets/img/wait.webp' instead of the standard animation icon. Use 35px x 35px as its size.

Use the provided styles.dart for styling.

Screens MUST NOT be different routes. Each screen is itself a widget.

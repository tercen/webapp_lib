USER -> DEVELOPER: Update request with specific requirements
note right: What needs to be changed,\nadded, or fixed

== Pre-Update Analysis Phase ==
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Analyze existing codebase structure
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Identify all files that need modification
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Map dependencies and integration points
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Assess impact on existing functionality
note right: Impact Assessment:\n- File Analysis\n- Component Dependencies\n- State Management\n- Service Integration

== Implementation Phase ==
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Read current implementation thoroughly
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Implement changes following existing patterns
note right: Change Implementation:\n- Minimal Impact\n- Backward Compatibility\n- Error Handling\n- State Consistency

DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Test changed functionality
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Perform regression testing on existing features
DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Verify integration with existing code
note right: Testing Requirements:\n- Changed Functionality\n- Regression Testing\n- Integration Testing\n- Edge Cases

DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Complete UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md
note right: Evidence Required:\n- Before/after screenshots\n- Modified files list\n- Testing performed\n- Compilation proof

DEVELOPER -> REVIEWER: Submit changes with documentation
note right: Submission includes:\n- Code changes\n- Before/after evidence\n- Testing summary\n- Impact analysis

== Review Phase ==
REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Review code changes for quality and consistency
REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Verify requirements are fully met
REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Test both new and existing functionality
REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Validate integration with existing codebase

alt Changes Meet Requirements
    REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Verify no regressions introduced
    REVIEWER -> REVIEWER: Confirm architectural consistency
    REVIEWER -> USER: Approve with review assessment
    note right: Approval includes:\n- Functionality verification\n- Regression test results\n- Integration confirmation
else Changes Need Improvements
    REVIEWER -> DEVELOPER: Return with specific feedback
    note right: Feedback includes:\n- Required fixes\n- Quality issues\n- Testing gaps\n- Pattern violations
    DEVELOPER -> DEVELOPER: Address feedback and retest
    DEVELOPER -> REVIEWER: Resubmit with improvements
